# Create-Spotify-Playlists

This program works similarly to how Spotify creates user playlists. The program prompts the user to specify the desired genre of music and then looks at the user's liked music and compares that to other public playlists with similar genres. It then uses these results to create a final playlist. 

It utilizes Spotipy and the Spotify Developer API which can be found here: https://developer.spotify.com/
